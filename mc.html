			<h1>Top 10 Best Anime MC's Of All Time</h1>
			<p>As hard as it is to admit, judging an anime is not always about the quality of the writing or animation. More often than not, it brings fans of any age back to the wild tribalism of their middle school lunch room as dominance is decided, not by wit or strength, but by a popularity contest. Which kid had the coolest shoes? Who had a cookie in their Lunchables? Whose dad "works at Nintendo"?</p>
            <p>As is constant with the early days of humankind, those who stand at the top are those who are most popular, and this is no different for anime and its characters, where the next casual fan may have their next anime of choice dictated by what they see the most, either in the recommendations of YouTube or on the backpacks and t-shirts of their fellow weebs.</p>
            <p>Whether it be the best looking, more intriguing, or most badass character, anime as a medium is one that is often defined by its most popular characters. Whether they perfectly condense all that one loves about a series into a personified form or just absolutely steal the show, anime characters are a performance worth paying for on their own. Bringing things back to the glory days of that middle school lunchroom, this list will be deciding who really is the coolest of the cool, as it runs down the Top 10 most popular characters in anime history (according to the community votes of My Anime List as of this writing).</p>

				<h2>Kiyotaka Ayanokōji</h2>

            <p>Kiyotaka is a tall young man with brown hair, brown eyes, and a fair complexion. He is usually seen wearing a standard school uniform. Outside of school, he wears a white hoodie covering a green shirt with an orange stripe along with brown pants. He is also seen wearing a blue vest over a white shirt and brown pants. He has grown taller since his first arrival at the school.</p>
            <p>He is considered to be very handsome, as was mentioned in the light novels, by Kikyō Kushida, that he ranked 5th in ikemen amongst the first-year boys. This is somewhat confirmed as he has attracted the attention of many girls in his class, some of whom are even very popular. Kei, before she officially started dating him, said he is considered to be in the top 10 of the hottest boys in the entire school. Satō finds him hotter than even Yōsuke Hirata despite being rejected by Kiyotaka.</p>

				<h2>Ken Kaneki</h2>
			</div>
			<img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kaneki-Ken-Featured-Image.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Ken Kaneki (金カネ木キ 研ケン, Kaneki Ken) is the main protagonist of the Tokyo Ghoul series. He is currently Touka Kirishima's husband, and the father of Ichika Kaneki. Previously, he was a student who studied Japanese literature at Kamii University, living a relatively normal life. However, this quickly changed after Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou was transplanted into him and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. Kaneki is the first known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His unique half ghoul state is what later inspires the idea of the Quinx. After joining Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually becomes known as Eyepatch (眼帯, Gantai).</p>
            <p>After being captured by Aogiri Tree, he underwent a drastic personality change and after escaping, formed a group with the goal of protecting those precious to him and exterminating individuals threatening his place of belonging. His kakuja form's distinct appearance earned him the alias Centipede (ムカデ, Mukade).</p>

				<h2>Keima Katsuragi</h2>

			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kaminomi/images/7/7a/Keima2.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20110421084255" alt="">
            <p>Keima is a young man who has brown hair and eyes, he wears glasses, has a bed hair sticking out and usually has a PFP in his hands. His uniform varies according to season. When he's not wearing it, he wears a long-sleeved shirt with a white collar and pants. He's also forced to wear a black (purple in anime) guillotine collar on his neck, proving he made a contract with Hell. Keima is also shown to be quite handsome, especially without his glasses. This is apparent, as when Keima ever approached a capture target, most of them tend to be flustered. And Ikumi Yoshino from the light novels even said that he looked like a "a rich kid hikkikomori! Or something like that."</p>
            <p>When he cross-dressed, he was able to enlarge his pupils, thus making himself look like a girl and even at that, he is able to attract boys into flirting with him (much to his annoyance). He also seems to be able to transform his face to a less attractive one when he doesn't want to be identified.</p>

            <p>Okabe has the characteristics of a lanky young man, with a square jaw and bony cheeks. He has his short black hair swept back and has brown irises, with a small amount of stubble on his chin and cheeks.</p>
            <p>Rintaro also wears a lab coat that reaches his shins, over a plain white T-shirt (light gray in the anime), and khaki-colored slacks. The breast pocket of his lab coat has a red pen sticking out, and around his slacks he wears a black military-style canvas belt, with a gold-colored buckle. He has dark socks and wears green slippers when inside the lab.</p>

				<h2>Rimuru Tempest</h2>
			</div>
			<img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rimuru-with-sword.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Rimuru initially appears as a blue-bodied Slime, but upon becoming a Demon Slime, his body turns silver with streaks of gold.</p>
            <p>As a slime, since his body is androgynous, anything he mimics takes on an androgynous form of the respective creatures, while still bearing huge resemblances to the individual creatures as well.</p>
            <p>His mass also grew over time, allowing him to accommodate larger mimicry forms without using extra magic to compensate for the additional mass. Towards the beginning of the story, he only has enough mass to appear as a human child, but each time he consumes a foe powerful in relation to his current strength, his size in human form shows a notable increase.</p>

            <p>Sora is a tall and lean young man with smooth fair skin, spiky black hair in the light novel (maroon in the anime). He has red eyes with dark bags under them most likely due to excessive gaming with little to no rest (sleep deprivation) and constantly wears a sly grin on his face. He was also seen in the old King's clothing and his yellow shirt with the text "I (heart) humanity" in Kanji, along with a blue undershirt with a red hand band and sneakers. He wears his crown on his left arm.</p>
            <p>Shiro is a cute pale-skinned girl with very long messy white hair that has a pale blue, purple, pink, green and yellow tint and large, passive golden/yellow-red eyes. She is rather slim and about average height (for an eleven-year-old). She often wears a purple sailor uniform which may be a bit oversized, along with thigh high stockings.</p>

				<h2>Rei Kiriyama</h2>

            <p>He is the main protagonist, whose progression is explored through the series. He is a teenage professional shogi player, currently ranked at 5th-dan (6th dan in the later part of the manga). He is widely lauded in the shogi community as the fifth shogi player to become a professional in middle school. Using his salary combined with his life savings, he lives in own apartment while juggling between his official matches and high school. By the time the story begins, Rei is also a frequent visitor of the Kawamoto residence, where the family treats him as one of their own despite his initial reluctance to become close with them.</p>
            <p>Kiriyama has black framed glasses and dark green eyes, clashing well with his wavy black hair, that almost looks shiny. He can usually be found in his adoptive father's old green sweater and/or his school uniform. His uniform is a simplistic design, with a white button up shirt and black pants. During colder months, he will also wear a long black coat that close with toggles. Rei's beady eyes thick hair close to his scalp and the fact that the sides of his mouth seem perpetually open give him the seeming of a lion-dog gargoyle, this could be a nod to his focused rigid and ambitious personality.</p>

            <p>Shinichi is of average height with a small build. In the manga he has short black hair and brown eyes, and is mentioned to have a somewhat feminine facial structure. In the anime, his hair and eyes are brown, and he initially wears large square-rimmed glasses.</p>

He also tends to wear T-shirts with strangely appropriate words written on them. For example, when he first meets Migi, he has a T-shirt that says "Misery Confusion". This repeats throughout the manga.</p>
